```
2. Install Wrangler CLI:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```
3. Authenticate with Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```
4. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
5. Configure your Gemini API key:
```bash
wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
```
6. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Frontend Application
1. Start the Expo development server:
```bash
npm start
```
2. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code, or run on an emulator:
- For iOS: `npm run ios`
- For Android: `npm run android`

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/process-receipt
Processes a receipt image and returns extracted items and total.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "imageData": "base64_encoded_image",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "string",

- Image processing errors are gracefully handled with user-friendly messages
- Network connectivity issues are properly managed
- Invalid data inputs are validated and appropriate feedback is provided

## Development Notes

- The backend uses Cloudflare Workers for serverless deployment
- The API uses the Gemini 1.5 model for optimal receipt processing
- Edge computing provides ultra-low latency globally
- CORS is configured to allow cross-origin requests
- The application supports both development and production environments

## Deployment

The backend is deployed on Cloudflare Workers, providing:
- ‚ö° Ultra-low latency (edge computing)
- üåç Global distribution (200+ locations)
- üìà Auto-scaling
- üí∞ Cost-effective (generous free tier)
- üîí Built-in security and DDoS protection
